## 3. Performance Optimization

- **State Management**:

  - Use immer with zustand for efficient and immutable state updates.
  - Minimize re-renders by optimizing state updates.

- **Rendering**:
  - Leverage Konva.jsâ€™s performance features for efficient canvas rendering.
  - Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.

---

## 4. Testing and QA

### Testing Libraries:

- Use Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all components.

### Error Handling:

- Implement logging mechanisms to catch and report issues.
- Use try-catch blocks and error boundaries for robustness.

---

## 5. Documentation

### Package Documentation:

- Provide detailed installation, usage, and API documentation.
- Include examples for common use cases.

### Modularity:

- Design the package to allow users to pick and choose features.
- Optimize bundle size and performance by allowing selective imports.

---

## 6. Additional Considerations

### AI-Assisted Features:

- Explore TensorFlow.js for shape suggestions and text conversion.
- Plan for integration in future updates.

### Gamification:

- Implement a scoring system for points and badges.
- Integrate leaderboards for collaborative sessions.

### Admin Panel:

- Consider using React Admin or similar libraries for dashboard components.
- Plan for backend integration if necessary.

# Canvas Tool Development Plan

## Project Overview

We are developing a customizable canvas tool library for a student learning platform, featuring drawing, text, image, and shape tools, along with advanced features like layer management, real-time collaboration, and export options. The library will be shareable as an npm package, allowing users to customize it via props.

## Phase 1: Setup and Core Features

1. **Project Initialization**

   - Set up the project using Vite for a modern and fast development setup.
   - Initialize necessary directories and files.

2. **Core Canvas Implementation**

   - Implement the basic canvas using Konva.js for drawing tools (pencil, eraser).
   - Add text and shape tools with customization options.

3. **Layer Management**
   - Develop a layer management system to handle multiple layers on the canvas.
   - Allow users to add, delete, reorder, hide, and lock layers.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

1. **Real-Time Collaboration**

   - Set up a backend server using Node.js and Socket.io for real-time collaboration.
   - Implement collaboration features with user roles (Viewer, Editor).

2. **Undo/Redo Functionality**

   - Use Immer and Zustand for state management, enabling undo/redo functionality.
   - Manage canvas state changes immutably.

3. **Export and Import Options**

   - Integrate jspdf and file-saver for exporting canvas content as PDF or image files.
   - Implement import functionality for previously saved projects.

4. **Templates and Pre-built Components**
   - Create predefined templates for common educational uses (mind maps, diagrams).
   - Allow users to import these templates into their canvas.

## Phase 3: Accessibility and Performance

1. **Accessibility Features**

   - Use react-aria to ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
   - Implement high contrast mode and adjustable font sizes.

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize canvas rendering with Konva.ts and lazy loading for images.
   - Ensure the library is efficient and responsive on all devices.

## Phase 4: Customization and Sharing

1. **Customization via Props**

   - Allow users to customize the toolbar and canvas via props (e.g., toolbarOptions, initialCanvasSize).
   - Provide flexibility in theming and feature enablement.

2. **NPM Package Preparation**
   - Package the library for npm distribution.
   - Ensure the package is well-documented and includes examples.

## Phase 5: Testing and Deployment

1. **Testing**

   - Write unit and integration tests for components and features.
   - Conduct cross-browser and device testing.

2. **Deployment**

   - Deploy the package to npm.
   - Provide documentation, including installation, usage, and API details.

3. **Support and Updates**
   - Gather user feedback for continuous improvement.
   - Plan for iterative updates and new feature additions.
